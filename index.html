  ],
  correctTag: "SCFHS",
  rationale: {
    correct: "Heat loss occurs by convection when the body is exposed to moving cooler fluid such as water.\n\n**Why and How:** Convection involves heat transfer through a moving medium (air or liquid) around the body. When the febrile infant is immersed in cold water, the moving water carries heat away from the skin, cooling the body rapidly. This is different from conduction, which requires direct contact with a solid, or evaporation, which involves liquid turning to vapor.",
    distractors: {
      NCLEX: "Evaporation requires liquid to gas conversion such as sweating.",
      SAFE_DELAY: "Conduction requires direct contact with a solid surface.",
      STR: "Radiation involves transfer of heat without contact."

    { text: "Conduction", tag: "SCFHS" },

  ],
  correctTag: "SCFHS",
  rationale: {
    correct: "Direct contact between the infant’s body and cold water causes heat loss through conduction.\n\n**Why and How:** Conduction is heat transfer through direct contact. When the infant is in cold water, heat moves from the infant’s warmer body to the colder water, lowering body temperature. Unlike convection, the water does not have to move significantly; contact alone allows energy transfer. Evaporation and radiation are not primary mechanisms in this scenario.",
    distractors: {
      SAFE_DELAY: "Evaporation involves vaporization of liquid, not immersion.",
      NCLEX: "Convection involves heat loss via air or fluid movement, not direct contact.",

  q: "A patient is admitted to the emergency department after sustaining abdominal injuries and a broken femur from a motor vehicle accident.

  ],
  correctTag: "SCFHS",
  rationale: {
    correct: "Massive trauma with hypotension, tachycardia, and signs of poor perfusion indicate hypovolemic shock due to blood loss.\n\n**Why and How:** Hypovolemic shock occurs when circulating blood volume drops significantly. Trauma with internal or external bleeding reduces preload, cardiac output, and tissue perfusion, causing tachycardia, hypotension, pallor, and altered mental status. Rapid recognition is essential to initiate fluid resuscitation. Other types of shock are less consistent with acute blood loss in trauma.",
